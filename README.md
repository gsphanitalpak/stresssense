## Introduction

StressSense is designed to monitor and predict stress levels by analyzing physiological parameters, including heart rate, body temperature, blood oxygen levels, and GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) data. It uses a combination of IoT devices and machine learning algorithms to provide valuable insights into stress management.

## Features

- **Real-time Stress Prediction**: StressSense provides real-time stress level predictions to help users manage their well-being effectively.

- **Customizable Alerts**: Users can configure stress level thresholds and receive alerts when stress levels exceed the defined limits.

- **Historical Data Analysis**: StressSense keeps a history of stress levels, enabling users to track their stress patterns over time.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The platform offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for stress level monitoring.
